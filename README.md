Welcome to Tyler and Jack's DHT:

* In order for our implementation to work properly, the "peerProfile.py", "net_functions.py", "hash_functions.py" files are required *
* To start a seed client, simply enter: "python3 bvDHT.py" *
* For any clients connecting to a user, use format: "python3 bvDHT 'IP' 'Port'" *
* To interact with the DHT locally, use the provided menu you will see upon start *
